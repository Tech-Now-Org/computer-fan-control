# Computer Fan Control

## About
Computer Fan Control is a technology designed to control the speed of computer fans for optimal cooling performance and noise reduction.

## Features
- Allows users to adjust fan speed based on temperature sensors and system load.
- Supports automatic fan speed control algorithms for intelligent cooling management.
- Provides options for manual fan speed adjustment for fine-tuning cooling performance.
- Compatible with various operating systems including Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

## How it Works
Computer Fan Control monitors system temperature sensors and system load to dynamically adjust the speed of computer fans. By regulating fan speed based on real-time data, it ensures efficient cooling while minimizing noise levels.
